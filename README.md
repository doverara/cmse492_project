# Designing a Scalable Data Pipeline for Cyber Threat Detection

This project focuses on building a scalable data pipeline capable of detecting cyber threats in real time by leveraging machine learning and network traffic analytics. The goal is to design an end-to-end workflow that ingests, preprocesses, and analyzes network data to identify patterns of anomalous or malicious activity.

In this initial phase, the project repository is being structured and the development environment is being configured. Future stages will involve data acquisition, preprocessing, model experimentation, and performance evaluation on simulated and real-world traffic datasets.
